# Rest Client

This is a simple library to make it easier to implement Rest requests and responses to leverage Rest APIs.

The idea is that you can simply create a class with some annotations to represent the payload for requests.

The response is simply a type to which the data will be mapped using [NewtonSoft Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json).
