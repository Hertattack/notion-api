# Notion API for C#

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Hertattack/notion-api)

This is my tinkering with the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) in C#. Feel free to use the code at your own risk :-) I have been using Notion for a while and wanted to see if I could make my notes even more useful for me.

My initial goal is to visualize the connections I have made between my notes in a graph. See the [Notion Visualizer](src/examples/NotionVisualizer/README.md) example's readme for more information on this.

Since I like programming I went a bit overboard and did not take the shortest path to the solution but created some libraries and a [Notion API Client](src/NotionApi/README.md) that I can expand as the API gets more functionality.
