# Notion Explorer

This is the Notion Explorer frontend that uses the [Notion API backend](https://github.com/Hertattack/notion-api).

The goal of the explorer is to transform the data stored in Notion and the relations between different pages into insights. To do this, you can execute queries on the relations between different information stored in the workspace.

For more information on the query language, please see [the readme for the graph database project](https://github.com/Hertattack/notion-api/tree/main/src/examples/NotionGraphDatabase)
